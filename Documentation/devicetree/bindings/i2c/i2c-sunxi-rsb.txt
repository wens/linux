* Allwinner RSB (Reduced Serial Bus) controller

Required properties :

 - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
 - compatible      : Should be "allwinner,sun8i-a23-rsb".
 - interrupts      : The interrupt line connected to the RSB peripheral.
 - clocks          : The gate clk connected to the RSB peripheral.
 - resets          : The reset line connected to the RSB peripheral.

Optional properties :

 - clock-frequency : Desired RSB bus clock frequency in Hz. If not set
		     the default frequency is 100kHz. Maximum is 20MHz.

An RSB device node may contain up to 15 child nodes each encoding an RSB
slave device.

Slave device properties:
  Required properties:
   - reg           : The runtime address used to access the device.
   - allwinner,rsb-hw-addr : The RSB hardware address for the device. This
			     is only used when configuring the runtime
			     address of the device.

  Valid runtime addresses - There are only 15 valid runtime addresses:

      0x17, 0x2d, 0x3a, 0x4e, 0x59, 0x63, 0x74, 0x8b,
      0x9c, 0xa6, 0xb1, 0xc5, 0xd2, 0xe8, 0xff


Example:

	rsb@01f03400 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-a23-rsb";
		reg = <0x01f03400 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 39 4>;
		clocks = <&apb0_gates 3>;
		clock-frequency = <3000000>;
		resets = <&apb0_rst 3>;

		axp223: pmic@2d {
			compatible = "x-powers,axp223", "x-powers,axp221";
			reg = <0x2d>;
			allwinner,rsb-hw-addr = <0x3e3>;

			/* ... */
		};
	};
